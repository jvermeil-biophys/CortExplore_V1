22-07-13_M1_P1_C1_disc20um,none,3mT,,,yes,
22-07-13_M1_P1_C2_disc20um,none,3mT,,,yes,"blebby in the bgeinning, but calms down after; can be seen in curve"
22-07-13_M1_P1_C3_disc20um,none,3mT,,,yes,Field too low and the bead stuck to the cell surface makes them move very far apart in Z and therefore makes it negative at the end.
22-07-13_M1_P1_C5_disc20um,none,3mT,,,no,
22-07-13_M1_P2_C3_disc20um,none,3mT,,,no,
22-07-26_M1_P1_C1_disc20um,none,3mT,,,yes,beads look a bit far
22-07-26_M1_P1_C5_disc20um,none,3mT,,,no,beads splits a bit in the middle because of lamellipodia
22-07-26_M1_P2_C1_disc20um,none,3mT,,,yes,oscillating
22-07-26_M1_P2_C3_disc20um,none,3mT,,,no,
22-07-26_M1_P2_C2_disc20um,none,3mT,,,no,oscillating but keeping it
22-07-26_M1_P3_C1_disc20um,none,3mT,,,no,beads split a bit towards the end; check again
22-07-13_M2_P1_C5_disc20um,none,7mT,,,yes,Bit of oscillation and curve increasing; maybe can be fixed; TRY!
22-07-13_M2_P1_C1_disc20um,none,7mT,,,yes,Very active; check if Z is detected well
22-07-13_M2_P2_C1_disc20um,none,7mT,,,yes,testing 3

22-07-13_M3_P1_C2_disc20um,none,15mT,,,yes,Curve is flat; beads are not pinching cortex

22-07-13_M3_P2_C3_disc20um,none,15mT,,,no,
22-07-26_M2_P3_C1_disc20um,none,15mT,,,yes,beads split in the beginning and movie is too short
22-07-26_M3_P1_C2_disc20um,none,15mT,,,no,oscillating a bit
22-07-26_M3_P1_C3_disc20um,none,15mT,,,no,testing 2
